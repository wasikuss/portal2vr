# ![Portal 2 icon](imgs/icon.jpg "Portal 2 icon") Portal 2 VR
### Use this mod at your own risk of getting VAC banned. Use the -insecure launch option to help protect yourself. (Also contains lots of flashing lights)

#### [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU-8-9qe6wQ)

## Things that work
* Singleplayer
* 6DoF VR view
* Motion controls for portal gun and grabbable objects
* Workshop content

## Things that need fixing
* Use the game's own haptic feedback
* In-game UI and pause menu are broken
* 6DoF and Roomscale needs to be reimplemented
* CPU is underutilized

## How to use
1. Download [Portal2VR.zip](https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases) and extract the files to your Portal 2 directory (steamapps\common\Portal 2)
2. Connect your headset, then launch Portal 2 with these launch options:
   
   ``` -insecure -window -novid +mat_motion_blur_percent_of_screen_max 0 +mat_queue_mode 0 +mat_vsync 0 +mat_antialias 0 +mat_grain_scale_override 0 -width 1280 -height 720 ```

3. At the menu, feel free to change [these video settings](https://i.imgur.com/yYQMXs6.jpg).
4. Load into a campaign. 
5. To recenter the camera height, press down on the left stick. To see the HUD, aim the controller up or down.

## Troubleshooting
If you have no audio:
* Go to ```steamapps\common\Portal 2\portal2_dlc3``` and execute ```UpdateSoundCache.cmd```
  
If the game isn't loading in VR:
* Try opening SteamVR before the game
* Disable SteamVR theater in [Steam settings](https://external-preview.redd.it/1WdLExouo_YKhTGT6C5GGrOjeWO7qNdIdDRvIRBhw-0.png?auto=webp&s=0d4447a9d954e1ec15b2c010cf50eeabd51f4197)

If the game is stuttering, try: 
* Steam Settings -> Shader Pre-Caching -> Allow background processing of Vulkan shaders

If the game is crashing, try:
* Lowering video settings
* Disabling all add-ons then verifying integrity of game files
* Re-installing the game

1. ``` git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr.git ```
2. Open l4d2vr.sln
3. Set to x86 Debug or Release
4. Build -> Build Solution
